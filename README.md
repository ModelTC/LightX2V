**LightX2V** is an advanced lightweight video generation inference framework engineered to deliver efficient, high-performance video synthesis solutions. This unified platform integrates multiple state-of-the-art video generation techniques, supporting diverse generation tasks including text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V). **X2V represents the transformation of different input modalities (X, such as text or images) into video output (V)**.

## 💡 Quick Start

For comprehensive usage instructions, please refer to our documentation: **[English Docs](https://lightx2v-en.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | [中文文档](https://lightx2v-zhcn.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/)**
